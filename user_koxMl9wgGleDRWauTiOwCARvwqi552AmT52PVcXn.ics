DESCRIPTION:************\nIntroduction\n************\n\nThroughout the 4 we
 eks of summer bridge\, you will explore important aspects of navigating co
 llege\, preparing for your career and reflecting on your personal identity
 . At the same time\, you will also be creating a personal website during y
 our morning computer science course. \n\nFor your final project\, you’l
 l bring this all together by creating a Photo Journal that lives on your p
 ersonal website. This project highlights who you are\, what you’ve learn
 ed\, and where you’re headed next. It connects the main themes from our 
 College Navigation class: community building\, college toolkit\, career pr
 eparation\, and personal reflection. This is your opportunity to be as cre
 ative as you’d like in a meaningful way.\n\nWe are not grading your code
 \, only on the content that you present. Review the grading rubric to see 
 what is expected and how this assignment will be graded.\n\nPrivacy Notice
 :\n\nYou have the option to keep it unlisted (for example\, not linking it
  from your homepage). This makes it more private\, but not completely priv
 ate as it’s possible that someone could find it through a very specific 
 Google search. \n\nPlease think carefully about how much personal informa
 tion you want to share. If your entry includes a photo with other people\,
  make sure you have their permission to post it. \n\n****[Challenge your 
 coding skills] Alternatively\, you can password lock your assignment and o
 nly provide the password to the grader when submitting your assignment. Pl
 ease see the instruction in the [UW-IT website for Basic Password Protecti
 on.] (https://uwconnect.uw.edu/it?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB003
 4452)\n\nOnce your assignment is fully graded\, you’re welcome to delete
  or remove the journal entry from your site. \n\n**********\nObjectives\n
 **********\n\nStudents will be able to utilize the skills they have learne
 d in the Computer Science portion of Summer Bridge in creating a personal 
 website and combine it with the information that they have learned during 
 the College Readiness & Navigation course. This will be a great chance to 
 really challenge themselves with exploring different features of programmi
 ng on their website. \n\nStudents can be as creative for this assignment 
 as long as they meet all the grading criteria. \n\n********\nTimeline\n**
 ******\n\nWe recommend you to work on this project at the end of each week
 \, and not wait until the end of the course as there will be lots of other
  projects/papers that will be assigned. \n\nThere will be a mid-point che
 ckpoint during the very beginning of week 3 (Tuesday\, September 9)\, wher
 e students will be expected to have finished at least one project for one 
 week. \n\n************\nInstructions\n************\n\nYou will create one
  journal entry on your personal website for each of the four course themes
 :\n\nWeek 1: Cohort & Campus Connection \n\n* Create meaningful connectio
 ns among cohort peers\, Allen Scholars Program staff\, and the university 
 community.\n\nWeek 2: College Toolkit \n\n* Develop academic habits and i

 ies and experiences and how they intersect with becoming a computer scient
 ist/engineer\n\n \n\nAs a reminder\, these are the activities that are co
 vered in each week that you can reference in your reflection:\n\n* Week 1:
  Building Tours\, Little Bobby\, Story Behind Your Name\, Campus Scavenger
  Hunt\, Lightning Talk\, Community Building Fun-gineering Activity.\n\n* W

 Lightning Talks\, LinkedIn\, Job Hunting Process\, Handshake\, Alumni Pane
 l\n\n* Week 4: Values Activity\, Multiple Identities\, Degree Planning\, A

 tant to you?\n\n* How might you use the skills you learned this week durin
 g the academic year? \n\n* What did this experience teach you? \n\n* How
  did you feel throughout the week?\n\nDue: Friday\, September 19th at 5PM 
 (LATE WORK WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED)\n\n********************\nSubmitting Your 
 Work\n********************\n\nYou must make a copy of the [Photo Journal S
 ubmission Template] (https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1ezD5_-L_GbAJA

 ted to your values.\n\n* Reflecting on your Past\, Present\, & Future Self
 \n\n* What do you want to remember about this moment in time and what you 
 would want to tell yourself at the end of your freshman year?\nBelow are s
 ome guiding questions to help with your reflection:\n\n* What identity is 
 most important to you / you are most proud of in this moment and why? \n\
 n* What are you excited\, anxious\, worried about and why?\n\n* Name a cha
